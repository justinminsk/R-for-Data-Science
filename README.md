# R-for-Data-Science

Going through and using examples and playing with code from the book by Hadley Wickman and Garrett Grolemund

## Information

This is my play ground to go through examples and think about the problems from the book. This book is an optional book and I am using it to learn outside of my Grad classes. I am omiting lots of functions which you can always find with help function in R. If I go through more books I will note that here.
