# R-for-Data-Science

Going through and using examples and playing with code from the book by Hadley Wickman and Garrett Grolemund

## Information

This is my play ground to go through examples and think about the problems from the book. This book is an optional book and I am using it to learn outside of my Grad classes. I am omiting lots of functions which you can always find with help function in R. If I go through more books I will note that here. 

###Known Problems
The website portion seems to be out of memeory. Might limit what I put up on there and turn it more into a ref. sheet but if you want to stay up to date you will need to either pull the R files and run them yourselfs or copy and paste off of the files to look at what the code is doing. There are still in line notes so you should still be able to follow along.
