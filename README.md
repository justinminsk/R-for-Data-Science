Going through and using examples and playing with code from the book by Hadley Wickman and Garrett Grolemund
## Information
This is my play ground to go through examples and think about the problems from the book. This book is an optional book and I am using it  
to learn outside of my Grad classes. If I go through more books I will note that here.
